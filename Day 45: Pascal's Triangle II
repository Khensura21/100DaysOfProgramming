//Time Spent: 45 mins
//Summary of Challenge: Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.
//Thoughts: This was challenging. I was trying to implement it via recursion, but I end up having to do it iteratively. 
//I have to definitely walk through this once more


**
 * @param {number} rowIndex
 * @return {number[]}

var getRow = function(rowIndex) {
    //output array
    let row = [1]
    //we want to build the Pascal's triangle
    // until the rowIndex
    //once we get on the target rowIndex, we want to push each value in 
    //that row , to the result's array
    for (let i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++){
        for (let j = i; j > 0; j--){
