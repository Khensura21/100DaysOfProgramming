//Summary of Challenge: Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, plus one to the integer.
  //The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contain a single digit.
  //You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
//Thoughts: This was a very tricky problem that took me a while too solve! I finally got some insight from other developers and got a better understanding of the problem to be able to solve it!

var plusOne = function(digits) {
    
  let n = digits.length - 1;
    
    for (let i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (digits[i] < 9) {
            digits[i]++;
            return digits;
        }
        digits[i] = 0 
    }
    
    digits.push(0)
    digits[0] = 1;
    return digits
};
